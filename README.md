## Changelog

### [2.9.0] - 2026-09-17

#### Added

##### Offline base map tiles support [Mapbox]

- The offline base-map tile API added to the Mapbox package -
  `MapsIndoors.setBaseMapTilesEnabled(enabled, apiKey)`,
  `MapsIndoors.synchronizeBaseMapTiles(onProgress?, apiKeys?)` and
  `MapsIndoors.isBaseMapCachingSupported()` - so the same code runs against either map provider.
  The Google Maps SDK exposes no per-region offline tile API, so `isBaseMapCachingSupported()`
  resolves `false` and `synchronizeBaseMapTiles` rejects with
  `MPError.baseMapCachingNotSupported` rather than silently doing nothing

##### Improved DirectionsRenderer

- `MPDirectionsRenderer.setOptions(options)` and `getOptions()`, which style a rendered route from a
  single `MPDirectionsRendererOptions` object - line color, opacity, weight and `MPStrokeStyle`, the
  background halo, the animated overlay and its `MPRouteAnimationType`, a repeating
  `MPRouteStampType` stamp with its `MPRouteArrowStyle`, `MPRouteMarkerDisplayRule` styling for the
  route's start and end markers, per connector `MPLegBoundaryIcons` and the camera's fit-bounds max
  zoom. The 3D elevation options are accepted but ignored, Google Maps keeps the route flat. Each
  option resolves on its own - the value set here, then the solution level default from the CMS,
  then the SDK's built-in default - so options left out are inherited rather than reset. This
  supersedes `setPolylineColors` and `setAnimatedPolyline`, which are now deprecated
- `MPDirectionsRenderer.finishGuidance(usagePercentage?)`, which signals that guidance on the
  current route has finished, optionally supplying how much of the route was travelled

##### Enhanced Language support

- `resolveLanguageTag(tag, availableLanguages)` and `normalizeLanguageTag(tag)`, for turning a
  device locale into the exact language tag a solution publishes before calling
  `MapsIndoors.setLanguage`. `resolveLanguageTag('zh-Hant-TW', solution.availableLanguages)`
  returns `'zh-Hant'`
- `MPSolution.resolveLanguage(language)`, the same lookup against that solution's own languages
#### Changed

- Updated the MapsIndoors Android SDK to 4.22.0 and the iOS SDK to 4.20.0, the releases that carry
  the base-map tile cache
- `MPSolution.hasLanguage` now matches language tags the way the native SDKs do, instead of
  requiring an exact string. Casing is ignored, the ICU underscore form is accepted (`zh_Hans`),
  legacy region-only Chinese tags resolve to their script (`zh-CN` matches `zh-Hans`, `zh-TW`
  matches `zh-Hant`), and a more specific tag falls back to a less specific one (`en-US` matches
  `en`). It stays deliberately strict about ambiguity: bare `zh` does not match a solution that
  publishes only `zh-Hans` and `zh-Hant`, because there is no way to tell which script is wanted
- `MapsIndoors.setLanguage` documents what its returned boolean means on each platform. On Android
  it is `false` for a language the solution does not have, and also while the SDK is still loading
  or synchronizing - in which case the change is queued rather than lost. On iOS it reports only
  that the tag was accepted, with no check against the solution. Read the language back with
  `getLanguage` to confirm a change took effect
- `MapsIndoors.setLanguage` resolves `false` for an empty language tag without calling into the
  native SDK, matching Android's own precondition. iOS would otherwise accept it and store an
  empty language

#### Fixed

- The iOS geometry helpers never decoded the polygon they were given, because
  `JSONDecoder` is not polymorphic and the SDK's internal `mp_polygon` accessors are nil on a
  freshly decoded value. `MPPolygon.contains` therefore always answered `false`, `getArea` always
  `0`, and `distanceToClosestEdge` resolved `undefined` despite being typed `Promise<number>`. The
  concrete geometry type is now decoded from the GeoJSON `type` discriminator, as on Android, so
  multi-polygon geometry works by construction
- Serialising SDK models to the bridge on Android walked native memory by reflection. `MPLocation`
  holds an `MPIcon` whose layer holds an `android.graphics.Bitmap`, and the buffer behind a Bitmap
  carries a `Cleaner` that is linked to every other live Cleaner in the process - so the work grew
  with whatever the host app had allocated, not with the map data. This only showed up on physical
  devices with a real app around them
- `MapsIndoors.setLanguage` always resolved `null` on iOS, despite being typed `Promise<boolean>`.
  It now resolves the native SDK's real result, as it already did on Android
- `MapsIndoors.getAvailableLanguages` and `getDefaultLanguage` rejected with an unparseable error
  on iOS when called before the solution had loaded, so the `MPError` never reached the caller.
  Both now reject with an `MPError`, as they already did on Android
- `MapsIndoors.getDefaultLanguage` resolved `null` on Android when no solution was loaded, despite
  being typed `Promise<string>`. It now rejects with an `MPError`, matching iOS
- `MapsIndoors.getSolution` resolved `null` on Android whenever no solution was loaded - including
  the moment right after a language change, which reloads the solution. Callers either crashed in
  `JSON.parse` or got a solution whose `availableLanguages` was `undefined`, so `hasLanguage`
  answered `false` for every tag. It now rejects with an `MPError`, matching iOS
- `MapsIndoors.getLocations` discarded a native rejection instead of propagating it, then failed
  in `JSON.parse` with "Unexpected character: u". The real error now reaches the caller
- `MPError.parse` threw a `SyntaxError` when a rejection did not carry the native SDK's JSON
  payload - a bridge-level or JavaScript error - replacing the real message with "JSON Parse
  error: Unexpected character". It now wraps such a message as an unknown error and keeps the text

### [2.8.0] - 2026-08-17

#### Changed

- **Breaking:** raised the minimum iOS deployment target to 16.0 (from 15.6), as required by the
  MapsIndoors iOS SDK. Update your Podfile, and `expo-build-properties`' `deploymentTarget` if you
  use Expo - see [iOS](#ios)
- **Breaking:** raised the minimum supported React Native version to 0.75.0
- Updated MapsIndoors Android SDK to 4.18.6
- Updated MapsIndoors iOS SDK to 4.19.1

#### Fixed

- The map turning black after navigating away from and back to the map screen when using
  `react-native-screens`' native stack
- The map continuing to render in the background while the app was backgrounded, which wasted
  battery
- `onLowMemory()` not being forwarded to the underlying Google Maps `MapView`

### 2.7.0

- Updated MapsIndoors Android SDK to 4.18.3
- Updated MapsIndoors iOS SDK to 4.17.2
- Added React Native New Architecture support (TurboModules / Fabric interop layer)
- Added `setPolylineColors` to `MPDirectionsRenderer` to allow customizing the foreground and background color of the displayed route

## Getting started

`$ npm install @mapsindoors/react-native-maps-indoors-google-maps`

### iOS

The MapsIndoors SDK requires iOS 16.0, so make sure that your podfile is configured for iOS 16.0.
Add `use_frameworks!` to your Podfile target.

```pod
platform :ios, '16.0'

target 'MyApp' do
  use_frameworks!
  ...
end
```

#### Providing API key

1. Navigate to `iOS/MyApp/AppDelegate.m`.
2. Import `#import "GoogleMaps/GoogleMaps.h"` on the class.
3. Add this code as the first line inside the application function: `[GMSServices provideAPIKey:@"YOUR GOOGLE MAPS API KEY HERE"];`

#### Adding MapsIndoors script specific to Google Maps, to Podfile

**Note from version 2.1.1 this is no longer necessary, and should be removed from the podfile if upgrading to 2.1.1**

After this you should navigate into the iOS folder of your react native project and add this script to the applications Podfile: [MapsIndoors podfile Post install](https://github.com/MapsIndoors/MapsIndoorsIOS/wiki/Podfile-post_install-v4)

### Android

#### Android Gooogle Maps Setup

​
To get the underlying Google Map to function, you need to perform the following steps:
​

1. Navigate to `android/app/src/main/res/value`.
2. Create a file in this folder called `google_maps_api_key.xml`.
3. Copy and paste the below code snippet and replace `YOUR_KEY_HERE` with your Google Maps API key.
4. Add the key to your application metadata in the manifest, located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
​

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="google_maps_key">YOUR_KEY_HERE</string>
</resources>
```

```xml
<application>
    ...
    <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.maps.v2.API_KEY"
            android:value="@string/google_maps_key" />
    ...
</application>
```

#### MapsIndoors Gradle Setup

​
The plugin Gradle project has trouble resolving the MapsIndoors dependency, so to ensure that it is resolved correctly, do the following:
​

1. Navigate to the app's project level `build.gradle`.
2. add `maven { url 'https://maven.mapsindoors.com/' }` to `allprojects`/`repositories` after `mavenCentral()`
​

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://maven.mapsindoors.com/' }
    }
}
```

### Expo

This library implements native modules and can't be used with ExpoGO, a development build is
required [Development Builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/).

To build and run correctly, the native ios linkage is required to be set as dynamic
(`useFrameworks: "dynamic"`). Project configuration can be done with the expo module
expo-build-properties.

This library includes an expo plugin to support native integration.
To enable it, you need to add the configuration in your expo configuration.

```json
// app.json

{
  "expo": {
    // ... your configuration
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-build-properties",
        {
          "ios": {
            "deploymentTarget": "16.0",
            "useFrameworks": "dynamic"
          }
        }
      ],
      [
        "@mapsindoors/react-native-maps-indoors-google-maps/app.plugin.js",
        {
          "apiKeyAndroid": "GMAPS_ANDROID_API_KEY",
          "apiKeyIOS": "GMAPS_IOS_API_KEY"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Showing your map

This snippet shows you how to set up MapsIndoors in a React Native application.

```javascript
import MapsIndoors, { MapControl, MapView } from 'react-native-maps-indoors';
...
//Function to initialize mapsindoors and mapcontrol. To load a solution and show data onto the map.
const loadMapsIndoors = () => {
    //Load solution data with your api key
    MapsIndoors.load('API_KEY').then(async () => {
        //Create the MapControl. Which will be using the MapView of the component.
        const mc = await MapControl.create(new MPMapConfig({useDefaultMapsIndoorsStyle: true}), NativeEventEmitter);
        //Get a venue and move the camera to it.
        let venue: MPVenue = (await MapsIndoors.getVenues()).getAll()[0];
        mapControl.goTo(venue);
    }
}

...
render() {
  return (
    <MapView
        style={{
            width: Dimensions.get('window').width,
            height: Dimensions.get('window').height,
        }}
    />
  );
}
...
```

### Showing a route

```javascript
  const showRoute = async () => {
    let point = new MPPoint(57.0580431, 9.9505475);
    let point2 = new MPPoint(57.0581638, 9.9507732, 10);
    var directionsService = await MPDirectionsService.create();

    //Optional query parameters for the route.
    directionsService.setIsDeparture(true);
    directionsService.setTime(Date.now());
    directionsService.setTravelMode('bicycling');

    var route = await directionsService.getRoute(point, point2);
    directionsRenderer = new MPDirectionsRenderer(NativeEventEmitter);
    directionsRenderer.setRoute(route);
  };
```

### Searching locations

This code snippet shows a function called `searchForParking` that takes a single argument of type `MPPoint`. The function uses `MapsIndoors` to search for locations matching the query string `"parking"` near the point specified, and uses the filter to only get the first 10 matches.
​
It mathces in the locations' descriptions, names, and external IDs to the query string. Once the search is complete, it is possible to update/get information from the locations (not specified in the code snippet).

```javascript
const searchForParking = async (point: MPPoint) => {
    let query = MPQuery.create({query: "parking",
                                near: point,
                                queryProperties: [MPLocationPropertyNames.description, MPLocationPropertyNames.name, MPLocationPropertyNames.externalId]});
    let filter = MPFilter.create({take: 10});
    let parkingLotsNearPoint = await MapsIndoors.getLocationsAsync(query, filter);
}
```

### Changing the look with DisplayRules

​
This code snippet shows three ways to manipulate display rules in the MapsIndoors SDK.
​
The `hideLocationsByDefault` method hides all markers that are not explicitly visible by setting the main display rule to not visible.
​
The `showLocationsByDefault` method ensures all markers are shown by setting the main display rule to visible.
​
The `changeTypePolygonColor(String type, String color)` method changes the fill color for all polygons belonging to a specific type. It gets the display rule for the specified type using `getDisplayRuleByName`, and sets the fill color using `setPolygonFillColor`.
​
These methods can all be used to customize the display of markers and polygons on the map.
​

```javascript
// This method changes the main display rule to hide all markers,
// This will cause all locations/types that are not explicitly visible to be hidden.
const hideLocationsByDefault = async () => {
    let mainDisplayRule = await MapsIndoors.getMainDisplayRule();
    mainDisplayRule?.setVisible(false);
}
​
// This method changes the main display rule to show all markers,
// This will cause all locations/types that are not explicitly visible to be shown.
const showLocationsByDefault = async () => {
    let mainDisplayRule = await MapsIndoors.getMainDisplayRule();
    mainDisplayRule?.setVisible(true);
}
​
// This method changes the fill color for all polygons belonging to a specific [type]
// the color MUST be a valid hex color string.
const changeTypePolygonColor = async (type: string, color: string) => {
    let typeDisplayRule = await MapsIndoors.getDisplayRuleByName(type);
    typeDisplayRule?.setPolygonFillColor(color);
}
```
