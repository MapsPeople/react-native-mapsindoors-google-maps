  # MapsIndoors' iOS SDK is consumed via CocoaPods, which resolves MapsIndoorsCore and the Google
  # Maps SDK transitively and embeds them into the consuming app.
  #
  # This deliberately does *not* use the Swift Package Manager integration introduced in SPEX-889:
  # `spm_dependency` attaches the packages to the Pods project's own target, and nothing then
  # embeds the resulting dynamic frameworks into the app bundle, so the app builds and links but
  # dies at launch with `Library not loaded: @rpath/MapsIndoorsCore.framework/MapsIndoorsCore`.
  # See SPEX-2429 before reintroducing SPM here.
